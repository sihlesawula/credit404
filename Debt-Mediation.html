      <h2>What is Debt Mediation?</h2>
      <p>
        Debt Mediation is a structured negotiation process where we engage directly with your creditors
        on your behalf to find a fair and affordable solution to your outstanding debts. The goal is to
        reduce financial pressure, prevent legal action, and help you regain control of your finances.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead of struggling alone with overdue accounts, high interest rates, and collection calls,
        our team works to reach agreements that make repayment realistic and manageable for your current
        financial situation.

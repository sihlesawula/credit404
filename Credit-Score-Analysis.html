      <h2>What is Credit Score Analysis?</h2>
      <p>
        Credit Score Analysis is a detailed review of your credit profile to understand exactly what
        is affecting your credit score. At Credit Room, we go beyond just telling you your score —
        we break down the reasons behind it and show you what needs to be fixed, updated, or removed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many people are declined for loans or credit because of errors, outdated records, or negative
        listings they didn’t even know existed. Our analysis helps you identify these issues and take
        the right steps toward improving your credit standing.
      </p>

      <h2>What We Check</h2>
      <ul class="service-list">
        <li>Incorrect or outdated listings on your credit profile</li>
        <li>Late payment records and their impact on your score</li>
        <li>Judgments, defaults, and adverse accounts</li>
        <li>Account balances and over-indebtedness</li>
        <li>Credit enquiries affecting your score</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How This Helps You</h2>
      <p>
        Once we complete your Credit Score Analysis, you will receive clear guidance on what actions
        to take to improve your score. This includes dispute processes, settlement advice, and
        responsible credit usage strategies.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether you want to qualify for a home loan, vehicle finance, or business funding, a strong
        credit profile gives you better approval chances and lower interest rates.
      </p>

      <h2>Who This Service Is For</h2>
      <ul class="service-list">
        <li>Anyone unsure why their credit score is low</li>
        <li>People who have been declined for loans or credit</li>
        <li>Individuals planning to apply for finance soon</li>
        <li>Anyone who wants to rebuild or strengthen their credit profile</li>

        <h2>What Is Debt Review Removal?</h2>
        <p>
          Debt review removal is the legal process of clearing your name from
          debt review once your obligations have been settled or when your
          financial position allows for early termination.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Credit Room, we guide you through the full legal and administrative
          process, working with credit bureaus, courts, and creditors to ensure
          your clearance certificate is issued and your credit profile is
          updated correctly.

      <div class="benefit-item">
        <h3>✔ Restore Your Credit Profile</h3>
        <p>
          Once removed, your credit report no longer reflects debt review,
          allowing lenders to assess your application normally again.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="benefit-item">
        <h3>✔ Access Loans & Credit</h3>
        <p>
          You regain eligibility to apply for home loans, vehicle finance,
          business funding, and personal credit.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="benefit-item">
        <h3>✔ Financial Freedom</h3>
        <p>
          You are no longer restricted by repayment caps and can manage your
          finances independently.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="benefit-item">
        <h3>✔ Peace of Mind</h3>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <div class="faq-container">

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How long does debt review removal take?</h3>
        <p>
          Depending on your situation, the process can take between 7 and
          21 working days once all documentation is in place.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I exit debt review early?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. If your financial position has improved or if your debts are
          settled, early removal may be possible.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Will my credit score improve immediately?</h3>
        <p>
          Your score may begin improving once the debt review flag is removed,
          but full recovery depends on your overall credit behavior.
